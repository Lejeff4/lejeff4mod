At some points Saori even believed Yukari would go off about tank models or start speaking about military life, just like she used to do back home. Nothing can last forever though, and as the night was winding down Yukari invited Saori to her place to stay the night. As they get settle into bed, Saori finally springs the statement that had been truly on her mind all night "I am scared of Red and Yellow"\n\nThis took Yukari by surprise, she never really thought of the possibility that they may frighten people with their being. After a bit of thinking Yukari spoke "But Saori, They are my friends and they are gonna help us make Saskatchewan great" Yukari lied, not about Red and Yellow helping make Saskatchewan great, but about caring about it. Truthfully, Yukari held hope in her heart that these men from outer space would be able to take her and her friends home someday. \n\n Saori really didnt trust Yellow and Red but she didnt press the issue to Yukari, she didnt want to start a fight after having such a great night as she and Yukari began to drift to sleep"

Yukari worried about how they would house such an army but Yellow assured her that the ship contained everything they would ever need for the next 1000 years.\n\nAs the ship lands, two prominent figures emerge. Yukari gets a good look at their attire, She immediately recognizes that they are wearing American General uniforms. "Are they really from Red and Yellows homeworld?" Yukari thought.

The soldiers felt shameful and embarassed as they realized just exactly what they were doing. They immediately apologize and untie her, then promptly telling her that saskatchewan wasnt safe anymore, Saori breathed easy knowing that she would be safe in the hands of these sympathetic soldiers."
ssk.71.a:0 "Perhaps elsewhere the same thing is going on?"

ssk.75.t:0 "The meeting"
ssk.75.d:0 "Yukari ran into the meeting room practically screaming. "WHY DID YOU KILL THEM". She is practically crying at this point. Red has a simple answer "because we had to, you dont understand! "Yellow said something more insightful "The political situation in Saskatchewan is delicate enough that if we didnt we could have faced another coup!"  "I wont lead with a group of murderers" Yukari hisses out after calming down\n"you dont have much of a choice" Red says coldly, this sudden shift scares Yukari a little "Wh-what do you mean?" Yukari stammers out "WE are the ones with the army" Red spits out as he points to himself and Yellow "So you are just gonna have to play ball with us and tell the people that your friends were conspirators and trying to overthrow the government" Yukari was angry, deeply angry but she knew she couldnt do anything about it and reluctantly agreed"
ssk.75.a:0 "The veil is lifted on the Imposters"

ssk.72.d:0 "Red and Yellow had called Yukari up for a meeting "We will be enacting a premptive strike on the world" Red said "The world eyes us as a symbol of changing times and a threat" Yellow said. Yukari was utterly shocked, "They must be insane!" Yukari thought. To take on the whole world would be suicide, and yet they looked at Yukari dead serious. Yukari, knowing they saw her hesistate, quickly says "but of course" "You will be acting as propaganda as usual" said Red. Yukari hated being a puppet, but moreso, she hated the fact that she trusted them.\n\nAs Yukari exited the building thinking of how she would be able to get the people to support what would essentially be a global conquest, when she spotted a military car two generals step out. The very same generals that she talked to when the ship first landed. "Ms Akiyama, you need to come with us" "What is this about?" Yukari asks "No time to explain" they say as Yukari gets into the car. "You see Yukari" one general said "The army is more loyal to their generals than their countrys government" "We still need time to plan things out, but we can help right the wrongs" Yukari looks distrustful "How can I trust you when you were the same men who killed my friends?" "We werent the officers conducting that purge, we are abhorred asmuch as you are from it"\n\n suddenly, the car stopped, they were at Yukari's house. "we will contact you later with details" one of the generals said as Yukari stepped out of the car. As the car drove away, Yukari felt a feeling she hadnt felt for a long while,hope, despite the looming war yukari was full of hope"

ssk.73.d:0 "Everything was perfectly set up. The time of the meeting, where they would sit, how long they would stay,. They even made sure all the loyalist divisions were on the frontline. Red and Yellow entered the meeting room and found no one. "thats stange" Red thought "Yukari was the one to call us here" "she wont be gone long" Yellow announced "she wouldnt dare stand us up like that". "I guess you're right" Red said almost sighing as he began to stare outside the window, blank expression on his face. Nearby, outside, Yukari stands waiting for the cue on the radio. She had been waiting months for this oppertunity, after months of pain and regret, this was her one and only chance to set things right. "Now!" the voice on the radio suddenly said. Yukari lifted her Stielhandgranate bundle, quickly aimed at the window and threw. By the time Red noticed, it was already to late. Soldiers swept into the building to confirm the deaths of Red and Yellow. Soon after she heard on the radio."

ssk.76.d:0 "Edward came home as he usually did, of course more fearful and worried than he had ever been before. "First these alien like men take control of our country" he thought "And next they declare an unwinnable war!". At this point he almost hoped that the coalition forces of the world would just finally end this madness.\n\nHe turned on the radio as he usually does when he gets home. But apon hearing Yukari's voice he scowls and get ready to turn the radio off. Yukari, to him and many others, was just a mouthpiece for the government, always spouting off about how the war can be won and that the people needed faith. As he was about to turn off the radio, he heard something that made him stop.\n\nYukari wasnt talking about the war or praising the government, she was talking of retaking control of the government from the evil space aliens and a new return to democracy and free elections. Of course, he didnt believe a word of it, but for a moment he wanted to believe she was being truthful."
ssk.76.a:0 "And so he dreamt"

ssk.78.t:0 "Snap Elections!"
ssk.78.d:0 "Hasty elections have been set up around the country.

ssk.74.t:0 "The Encounter"
ssk.74.d:0 "Yukari sat at her desk looking over documents chock full of boring legislation and law. She stared at them a little longer, sighed and started looking out the window. While Yukari is in Saskatchewan physically, her mind and heart are at home at Ooarai. After so many years no one has come close to an answer on how all of these girls could fall asleep onboard their ships one night and wake up in Saskatchewan the next morning. Yukari found it weird how the only linking factor between all of these students were that they were members of their schools Sensha-dō teams. \n\n Suddenly Red and Yellow came into her office. They wanted to know when they can expect to lift marshal law. Yukari looked away and muttered that would only happen once the citizens calmed down. Despite the unsatisfactory answer, Yellow and Red still left her office and let Yukari be alone.\n\nYukari sat and relooked over the documents but found her mind wandering to the time when she met Red and Yellow. It wasnt to long after Yukari woke up in saskatchewan, thousands of miles away from home. She was chosen to scout out the north for the girls. It was midday when Yukari came across them, They claimed to be from space and said that their ship had crashed many miles up north. Yukari promised not to tell the others about them and they were grateful. And so it was, Red and Yellow settled close to where the others had set up base, with Yukari checking up on them every so often to make sure they were alright, eventually gaining enough trust to involve them in the coup. \n\n But that was the past and now Yukari has to deal with leading a nation."
